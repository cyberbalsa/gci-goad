# IMPORTANT: Credentials are loaded from environment variables
#
# Setup instructions:
# 1. Download your OpenStack credentials file from the dashboard:
#    Identity → Application Credentials → Download openrc file
# 2. Move the file to the project root and run quick-start.sh
# 3. Before running tofu commands, always source the credentials:
#    source ../app-cred-openrc.sh
#
# The provider automatically reads these environment variables:
# - OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID
# - OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET
# - OS_REGION_NAME (optional)
