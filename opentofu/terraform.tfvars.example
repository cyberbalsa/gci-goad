# Example configuration for GOAD OpenStack deployment
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed

# Number of complete GOAD instances to deploy (each has 5 Windows VMs)
# For example:
#   goad_instance_count = 1   -> 5 Windows VMs (1 GOAD lab)
#   goad_instance_count = 2   -> 10 Windows VMs (2 GOAD labs)
#   goad_instance_count = 10  -> 50 Windows VMs (10 GOAD labs)
#   goad_instance_count = 30  -> 150 Windows VMs (30 GOAD labs)

# REQUIRED: Set this to your OpenStack SSH keypair name
